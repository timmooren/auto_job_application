The dislike of rainy days is a personal opinion of mine.

In 1816, there was heavy rainfall in Europe, particularly in Switzerland, where it rained on 130 out of the 183 days from April to September. Mary Shelley spent the summer of 1816 in the environs of Geneva and, as a way to pass the time indoors without television or other amusements, found inspiration in German ghost stories. She stated, "These tales excited in us a playful desire of imitation." Thus, Mary Shelley wrote a novel due to the inclement weather that confined them inside. I can relate to her situation and would probably write a novel in similar circumstances.
